    Generally the player with the card of lowest value must drink some of his personal drink. (There is not standard measure of how much he must drink, the other players will normally complain if he drinks to little.)
    -The ace is the lowest card (valued as a 1), but:
    7 is considered to be lower than 1
    10 is considered to be lower than 7

    Special cards:
    If one player gets a king he must drink the "Kings drink"
    For each player that gets a queen every other player with a picture card (king,queen or jack) must drink some of his personal drink.
    For each player that get a jack every other player must drink some of his personal drink.
    If a player receives a 6 of hearts he is to be given three new cards and all players must act according to these cards before a new round is started.
    If a player receives a 6 of diamonds the player to the left of him is to be given three new cards and all players must act according the these cards before a new round is started.

    After each round new drinks should be mixed (if any of them have been drunk), before starting a new round. When all cards in the deck have been dealt, the deck is passed on to the player to the left of the current dealer.
    Draw situations
    If two players ends up with the lowest card, they both have to drink of their personal drink, and both receive a new card and have to act according to these two new cards.
    If two players receives a king, both players receives a new card and the one with the lowest valued card have to drink the "Kings drink"
